# Physical Assembly

## Parts

* 1 x My Bike's Got LED board, with USB connector on the short side and the vertical JST-PH battery connector fitted
* 1 x toggle switch
* 1 x inner end-cap
* 1 x PCB to battery adaptor
* 1 x brace
* 1 x 2x2 18650 battery pack, with JST-PH connector
* 2 x LED strip endcaps
* 3 x 29 LED strips
* 3 x LED backing strips
* Some double-sided tape, unless the LED strips are self-adhesive
* Some electricians tape
* 2 x PVC 50mm plumbing end-caps
* 66cm 50MM frosted polycarbonate tube
* 4 x M3 bolts
* 4 x M3 nuts
* ~20cm of ribbon
* Solvent weld
* An elastic band
* 1 x top cap

## Instructions

### Electronics

1. Solder wires to the toggle switch and then to the two terminals on the PCB, with the wires sitting on the underside of the PCB
1. Solder two sets of LED wiring - power/ground/data - to the underside of the PCB, to 5V/GND and Data and Clk
1. Solder the remaining set of LED wiring to 5V/GND/IO3 on the top side of the PCB, with the solder bridge to enable IO3 on the level-shifter
1. Solder the other ends of the LED wires to the LED strips

### Outer Tube

1. Glue the PVC end-caps onto the polycarb tube with solvent weld

### Inner Assembly

1. Stick the LED strips to the backing strips
1. Fasten the toggle switch into the inner-end-cap
1. Bolt the PCB to the inner-end-cap with two M3 nuts and bolts
1. Feed the two sets of LEDs from the underside of the PCB through the side of the PCB-to-battery adaptor with the notch for the brace
1. Feed the remaining set of LEDs through the other side of the PCB-to-battery adaptor
1. Bolt the PCB to the PCB-to-battery adaptor with two M3 nuts and bolts
1. Attach the brace to the PCB-to-battery adaptor and one of the LED strip endcaps
1. Feed the ribbon through the cut-out in the LED strip endcap and then both ends of it through the PCB-top-side hole in the PCB-to-battery adaptor
1. Insert the battery and feed its wiring through the PCB-top-side hole in the PCB-to-battery adaptor
1. Hook the LED strips onto their relative convenient hooks on the LED endcap, routing the wires around the peg
1. Tape the LED wiring to the side of the battery with some electrician tape, to keep it roughly in place.  Spare wire can be fed through to sit alongside the PCB
1. Hook the other end of the LED strips onto the other LED strip endcap

### Final Assembly

1. Feed some string or wool through the tube, and then through the cut-out in the not-PCB-end LED strip endcap
1. Attach the elastic band through the not-PCB-end LED strip endcap
1. Slowly pull the inner assembly through the tube until the PCB end cap seats onto the PVC endcap
1. Attach the elastic band from the top LED tensioner
